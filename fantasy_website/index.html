	<h1>The Seven Skies</h1>
		<img src="images/starrysky.jpg" alt="Starry Sky" width="600"> <img src="images/cloudysky.jpg" alt="Cloudy Sky" width="610">
		<p>Let me tell you, about the world called <em>The Seven Skies</em>, a world where millions enter with one goal in mind- to conquer the seven parallel worlds and to gain the title of The Sky King. The world of <em>The Seven Skies</em> consists of seven parallel worlds for players to explore and conquer, each one themed with a different sky- <em>Rainy, Clear, Sunny, Cloudy, Snowy, Day and Night.</em> Each world is different with their own towns and cities, items, and monsters that you’ll only find there, although there might be some monsters you can find in two or more worlds.</p>
		<p>Each world has different monsters of all kinds to battle against and defeat, each one themed to the one of the seven parallel worlds- to rise through ranks by defeating them. Every world has a secret boss room that you, yourself will have to find. Only those who defeat the boss will have the authorization to go through the door to the next parallel world and gain a special item of that class! Meaning, if you are a Magician then you could gain some type of magic item or if you are a Knight, you could gain a powerful, (maybe even rare) sword or shield. But those who fail will start over in the Beginning Town of that world.</p>
		<p>New weapons and items can be unlocked the farther you go through each world. The farther you get and the higher your level goes, the more powerful you become. You may seek out and challenge other players to duels in order to gain experience and level up. The winner will receive a prize of money of difference amounts, depending on the level that player is on. The loser will either end up that world’s Beginning Town, ending up with nothing, or can be revived and join that players team if wanted. In this world, you can choose from six different classes- <em>The Fighter Class, The Magician Class, The Rogue Class, The Cleric Class, The Ranger Class, and Rarer Class Archetypes</em>; however, with each class there are different sized subgroups to choose from. But there is one thing you must know, you get to choose what type of fighter or wizard you can be, but the system chooses the Class you are in.</p>

		<p>A well-balanced party of these players will usually benefit from it. May it be good or bad, you’ll just have to see that when the time comes. However, if players have a hard time forming a party, you may join a guild that will usually accepts any player no matter what class or group they are in. Although, you should do well to remember that each guild is different and has its own standards. Every player will have a second name or username from their real one in the game of their choosing and cannot have the same one as another player. If players die, they will either start over in the world's Beginning Town or have the option to let a party member (if they have one) revive them with an item.</p>
		<p>Collect items for selling, fighting, healing; even cooking! For so many things you are able to do! Discover new weapons that can increase your power and defense. Rise up through the different levels of the 7 parallel worlds and make new friends throughout the entire gameplay.</p>
